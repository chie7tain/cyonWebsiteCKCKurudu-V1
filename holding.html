            CYO Nigeria was founded in 1985 to create a youth organization for young Catholics in Nigeria.CYO emerged in the
            context of a concern of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) that the young Catholics and local Catholic
            youth organizations in Nigeria should celebrate the International Youth Year (IYY) declared by the United Nations in
            1985. Several meetings of chaplains responsible for youth affairs and youths leaders from the various dioceses of
            Nigeria took place to plan a national Catholic youth rally. From this type of rallies finally CYO Nigeria emerged as a
            nationwide umbrella for Catholic youth work in Nigeria.In 2010, at the General Assembly in Munich, CYO Nigeria was
            adopted as a full member to the international umbrella of Catholic youth organizations "Fimcap". Currently, CYO
            Nigeria is building up a cooperation with a Muslim youth organization to foster peace in the country and to begin an
            inter-religious dialogue.

            The youth apostolate has been the major concern of the Catholic Church. So many times they have not failed to portray
            this as they are the future of the Church. The need to guard this future gave birth to the Catholic Youth Organization
            of Nigeria (CYON) established by the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria in the year 1985.
            Youths are instrumental in the Building of the Church. They are the future of the Church. The Archdiocese of Abuja
            under
            the Leadership of His Eminence, Dominic Cardinal Ekandem and His able successor, Most Rev. Dr. John Onaiyekan (now His
            Eminence John Cardinal Onaiyekan) has indeed moved from strength to strength leaving no stone unturned. Having been
            raised to the status of an Archdiocese in 1994, many bountiful progress in many areas especially Evangelization,
            Education and health were recorded. During this period, many statutory Organizations were also raised including the
            Catholic Youth Organization of Nigeria which was approved by the Catholic Bishop Conference of Nigeria in the Catholic
            Archdioceses of Abuja. The organization affirms the place of youth in the Church’s life and promotes youth involvement
            in the work of evangelization. It outlines, promotes, direct and evolve network of support for youth initiatives as
            groups or as individuals for the development of the Church and the Society.

            Sequel to the many leadership challenges among the and setbacks of the Catholic Youth Organization, the Parish Youth
            Council was formed in August, 2007 in a letter titled: Formation of the Parish Youth Council written to all Parish
            Priests by His Grace the Archbishop of Abuja. In the preamble of the guidelines on the formation of the Parish Youth
            Council, he stated that it is to be made up of representatives drawn from all the statutory youth societies in the
            church, the societies here referred to are strictly for the Youths and not those whose membership are opened to
            children
            but for the Youths and adult alike. The vision of the Archbishop in forming the parish Youth Council was to see to the
            building of a formidable, vibrant Youth Ministry in the Archdiocese where young people will contribute their quota to
            the growth of the church in their time.
          </p>
          <p class="about-us-text-content">
            The Church realized with regret that an overwhelming percentage of all the Youth bodies in the Archdiocese do not
            belong
            to any of the Youth organ. Moreover, there were many cases of mistakes, misunderstandings, setbacks and leadership
            challenges among the different Youth Organizations constituting the Youth Council. It was based on these observations
            that the church decided to restructure the Youth Apostolate. In January 2011, a National Conference was organized by
            the
            Catholic Secretariat of Abuja to address the concerns and sentiments of the Youth with a view to finding lasting
            solutions to them. Emphasis were made on the character of the church which is One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic and
            the
            need for the Youth apostolate in the various dioceses to work in harmony under one umbrella.

          <p class="about-us-text-content">
            After a Restructuring Abuja Youth Summit which was organized on 13th – 15th of December, 2011 at Regina Pacis Girls
            College, Garki II, Abuja; a summit well attended by youth delegates from all the parishes and youth organizations in
            Abuja, with some parish chaplains and the Metropolitan Archbishop himself present, the Old CYON in Abuja Archdiocese
            was
            restructured. The summit was aimed at re-evaluating the AYC structure and critically evaluating the extent of its
            impact
            in the lives of the youths in the Archdiocese and the entire Youth Ministry. It was also geared towards addressing the
            problems of structure and organization of youths in Abuja Archdiocese.

            After series of inspiring sessions and with active participation of the His Eminence, John Cardinal Onaiyekan under
            the
            guidance of the Holy Spirit, the summit has come to be adjudged by many, if not all, as the best thing that has ever
            happened to the youth apostolate in the Archdiocese of Abuja as it brought about the dissolution of former Youth
            Groups
            like AYC and the former CYON to bring about what is well known as the “NEW CYON” (the beginning of a new dawn). All
            young Catholics in Abuja Archdiocese will be under this umbrella body- “New CYON”. Then six man caretaker committee
            was
            appointed by the Archbishop to run the affairs of the CYON until the Archdiocese conducts a credible election.

            Sequel to this development, a circular was passed to all parishes in the Archdiocese on the directives of the new CYON
            and its modalities for implementation. Following this, a full time Youth Chaplain was immediately appointed by the
            Archbishop of Abuja in the person of Rev. Fr. John Sixtus Okonkwo.

            Having conducted election at various parishes; the Archdiocesan Election was awaited by all and on June 15th-17th,
            2012
            at DRACC Lugbe, another remarkable experience in the history of the youth of Abuja Archdiocese took place. It was one
            that will never be forgotten in a hurry; “The Leadership Seminar”. Following the reformation of the new CYON in the
            Archdiocese of Abuja by his Eminence, John Cardinal Onaiyekan, the Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, 175 youth delegates
            from the various parishes (four from each Parish) in Abuja Archdiocese converged at DRACC Sabon Lugbe for the
            leadership
            seminar. The seminar was aimed at preparing the young minds to assume responsibilities as well as face the challenges
            that come with such responsibilities and thereafter, to become effective and responsible leaders of this era, both in
            the Church and the society at large. On June 17th, 2012, an Archdiocesan Election for the new CYON was conducted
            amongst
            the delegates, as newly elected executive emerged in the Archdiocese of Abuja.
            They were formally inaugurated by His Eminence, John Cardinal Onaiyekan, the Archbishop of Abuja on 14th July, 2012 at
            the 2nd Council Meeting of the New CYON Abuja Archdiocese at Church of Assumption Parish Asokoro, Abuja.
            In line with the restructuring of the Catholic Youth Organization in Abuja, a new Archdiocesan Youth Coordinator;
            Emmanuel John Nkanta, was employed by the Archdiocese to assist the Archdiocesan Youth Chaplain in his administrative
            works and also to coordinate and execute plans, activities and programs as approved by the Archdiocesan Youth
            Executive
            Council headed by the Archdiocesan Youth Chaplain.

                  It
                  was one
                  that will never be forgotten in a hurry; “The Leadership Seminar”. Following the reformation of the new CYON

                  the
                  leadership
                  seminar. The seminar was aimed at preparing the young minds to assume responsibilities as well as face the
                  challenges
                  that come with such responsibilities and thereafter, to become effective and responsible leaders of this
                  era,
                  both in
                  the Church and the society at large. On June 17th, 2012, an Archdiocesan Election for the new CYON was
                  conducted
                  amongst
