              CYO Nigeria was founded in 1985 to create a youth organization for young Catholics in Nigeria.CYO emerged in
              the
              context of a concern of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) that the young Catholics and local
              Catholic
              youth organizations in Nigeria should celebrate the International Youth Year (IYY) declared by the United
              Nations in
              1985. Several meetings of chaplains responsible for youth affairs and youths leaders from the various dioceses
              of
              Nigeria took place to plan a national Catholic youth rally. From this type of rallies finally CYO Nigeria
              emerged as a
              nationwide umbrella for Catholic youth work in Nigeria.In 2010, at the General Assembly in Munich, CYO Nigeria
              was
              adopted as a full member to the international umbrella of Catholic youth organizations "Fimcap". Currently,
              CYO
              Nigeria is building up a cooperation with a Muslim youth organization to foster peace in the country and to
              begin an
              inter-religious dialogue.

              The youth apostolate has been the major concern of the Catholic Church. So many times they have not failed to
              portray
              this as they are the future of the Church. The need to guard this future gave birth to the Catholic Youth
              Organization
              of Nigeria (CYON) established by the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria in the year 1985.
              Youths are instrumental in the Building of the Church. They are the future of the Church. The Archdiocese of
              Abuja
              under
              the Leadership of His Eminence, Dominic Cardinal Ekandem and His able successor, Most Rev. Dr. John Onaiyekan
              (now His
              Eminence John Cardinal Onaiyekan) has indeed moved from strength to strength leaving no stone unturned. Having
              been
              raised to the status of an Archdiocese in 1994, many bountiful progress in many areas especially
              Evangelization,
              Education and health were recorded. During this period, many statutory Organizations were also raised
              including the
              Catholic Youth Organization of Nigeria which was approved by the Catholic Bishop Conference of Nigeria in the
              Catholic
              Archdioceses of Abuja. The organization affirms the place of youth in the Church’s life and promotes youth
              involvement
              in the work of evangelization. It outlines, promotes, direct and evolve network of support for youth
              initiatives as
              groups or as individuals for the development of the Church and the Society.

            <p class="about-us-text-content">
              Sequel to the many leadership challenges among the and setbacks of the Catholic Youth Organization, the Parish
              Youth
              Council was formed in August, 2007 in a letter titled: Formation of the Parish Youth Council written to all
              Parish
              Priests by His Grace the Archbishop of Abuja. In the preamble of the guidelines on the formation of the Parish
              Youth
              Council, he stated that it is to be made up of representatives drawn from all the statutory youth societies in
              the
              church, the societies here referred to are strictly for the Youths and not those whose membership are opened
              to
              children
              but for the Youths and adult alike. The vision of the Archbishop in forming the parish Youth Council was to
              see to the
              building of a formidable, vibrant Youth Ministry in the Archdiocese where young people will contribute their
              quota to
              the growth of the church in their time.
            </p>
            <p class="about-us-text-content">
              The Church realized with regret that an overwhelming percentage of all the Youth bodies in the Archdiocese do
              not
              belong
              to any of the Youth organ. Moreover, there were many cases of mistakes, misunderstandings, setbacks and
              leadership
              challenges among the different Youth Organizations constituting the Youth Council. It was based on these
              observations
              that the church decided to restructure the Youth Apostolate. In January 2011, a National Conference was
              organized by
              the
              Catholic Secretariat of Abuja to address the concerns and sentiments of the Youth with a view to finding
              lasting
              solutions to them. Emphasis were made on the character of the church which is One, Holy, Catholic and
              Apostolic and
              the
              need for the Youth apostolate in the various dioceses to work in harmony under one umbrella.

            <p class="about-us-text-content">
              After a Restructuring Abuja Youth Summit which was organized on 13th – 15th of December, 2011 at Regina Pacis
              Girls
              College, Garki II, Abuja; a summit well attended by youth delegates from all the parishes and youth
              organizations in
              Abuja, with some parish chaplains and the Metropolitan Archbishop himself present, the Old CYON in Abuja
              Archdiocese
              was
              restructured. The summit was aimed at re-evaluating the AYC structure and critically evaluating the extent of
              its
              impact
              in the lives of the youths in the Archdiocese and the entire Youth Ministry. It was also geared towards
              addressing the
              problems of structure and organization of youths in Abuja Archdiocese.

              After series of inspiring sessions and with active participation of the His Eminence, John Cardinal Onaiyekan
              under
              the
              guidance of the Holy Spirit, the summit has come to be adjudged by many, if not all, as the best thing that
              has ever
              happened to the youth apostolate in the Archdiocese of Abuja as it brought about the dissolution of former
              Youth
              Groups
              like AYC and the former CYON to bring about what is well known as the “NEW CYON” (the beginning of a new
              dawn). All
              young Catholics in Abuja Archdiocese will be under this umbrella body- “New CYON”. Then six man caretaker
              committee
              was
              appointed by the Archbishop to run the affairs of the CYON until the Archdiocese conducts a credible election.

              Sequel to this development, a circular was passed to all parishes in the Archdiocese on the directives of the
              new CYON
              and its modalities for implementation. Following this, a full time Youth Chaplain was immediately appointed by
              the
              Archbishop of Abuja in the person of Rev. Fr. John Sixtus Okonkwo.

              Having conducted election at various parishes; the Archdiocesan Election was awaited by all and on June
              15th-17th,
              2012
              at DRACC Lugbe, another remarkable experience in the history of the youth of Abuja Archdiocese took place. It
              was one
              that will never be forgotten in a hurry; “The Leadership Seminar”. Following the reformation of the new CYON
              in the
              Archdiocese of Abuja by his Eminence, John Cardinal Onaiyekan, the Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, 175 youth
              delegates
              from the various parishes (four from each Parish) in Abuja Archdiocese converged at DRACC Sabon Lugbe for the
              leadership
              seminar. The seminar was aimed at preparing the young minds to assume responsibilities as well as face the
              challenges
              that come with such responsibilities and thereafter, to become effective and responsible leaders of this era,
              both in
              the Church and the society at large. On June 17th, 2012, an Archdiocesan Election for the new CYON was
              conducted
              amongst
              the delegates, as newly elected executive emerged in the Archdiocese of Abuja.
              They were formally inaugurated by His Eminence, John Cardinal Onaiyekan, the Archbishop of Abuja on 14th July,
              2012 at
              the 2nd Council Meeting of the New CYON Abuja Archdiocese at Church of Assumption Parish Asokoro, Abuja.
              In line with the restructuring of the Catholic Youth Organization in Abuja, a new Archdiocesan Youth
              Coordinator;
              Emmanuel John Nkanta, was employed by the Archdiocese to assist the Archdiocesan Youth Chaplain in his
              administrative
              works and also to coordinate and execute plans, activities and programs as approved by the Archdiocesan Youth
              Executive
              Council headed by the Archdiocesan Youth Chaplain.
